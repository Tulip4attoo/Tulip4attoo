### Hi folk ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github. I don't know how you got there, whether it was through some of my blog posts, my CV, or symply Googling or searching for a project on Github. However, it's a pleasure to meet you.

Oh, I should introduce myself first.

Some words to describe me: Gamer, Wonderer, Dreamer, Programmer, Wanderer.

I am always excited by novelty and disruptive of conventional ways of thinking and doing. I am also deeply motivated to challenge myself and pursue projects that promote personal growth. 

In short, I love making stuff and solving problems.
