------------

I love making stuff and solving problems. My archetypes of **Inventor** 🔧, **Explorer** 🌍, and **Individualist** 🦄 truly define my approach to life and work.

I'm super into  **Unreal Engine 5** (UE5) 🎮, **AI** 🤖, and **Virtual/Augmented Reality** (VR/AR) 🕶️. I believe these technologies are gonna change how we live, work, and interact.

I also love to:

+ 🎮 Playing Video games. I really love Elden ring, LoL, DotA
+ 📚 Writing tech blog posts to share my thoughts and experiences with other developers
+ 🚀 Working on side projects to sharpen my skills and try out new tech
+ 📚 Reading a good book, 'cause there's always more to learn
+ 🏃‍♂️ Keeping active to stay sharp, since a healthy body helps a healthy mind
+ 🎨 Enjoying art and creativity, which inspires me and helps me think differently

If you have a cool project, hit me up. Let's make something awesome together and change the world! 🚀
