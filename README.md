### Hi folk ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github. I don't know how you got there, whether it was through some of my blog posts, my CV, or symply Googling or searching for a project on Github. However, it's a pleasure to meet you.

Oh, I should introduce myself first.

Some words to describe me: Gamer, Wonderer, Dreamer, Programmer, Wanderer.

I am always excited by novelty and disruptive of conventional ways of thinking and doing. I am also deeply motivated to challenge myself and pursue projects that promote personal growth. 

In short, I love making stuff and solving problems.

![My Trait](/my-trait.png)

I spend years of my life learning and working in data/AI field. After some years, [I realized that I created nothing](https://youtu.be/M5v1nXiUaOI) except [a pet project from long time ago](https://github.com/Tulip4attoo/chrome_trex). I know that I need some changes.

Everything seemed clear when I first saw [Unreal Engine 5 Revealed!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC5KtatMcUw). Now, I will change my career into gamedev. Here is [my first demo project on UE5](https://github.com/Tulip4attoo/Soul-like-Game-UE5).

I have:
+ [a blogs (Vietnamese)](https://tulip4attoo.github.io/) where I write about my side projects, competitions and technical things.
+ [a Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/thuylinh8910/videos) where I post some pieces of my works here.

### I am currently looking for a job that uses UE5.

Here is [my CV](/LinhNguyen_Gamedev.pdf): https://github.com/Tulip4attoo/tulip4attoo/blob/main/LinhNguyen_Gamedev.pdf
